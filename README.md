ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mary, 

Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington - Seattle, pursuing Master of Science in Information Management with specializations in Data Science and Business Intelligence. 
My passion lies in data analysis, and I am dedicated to leveraging advanced analytical techniques to tackle real-world problems.
The primary programming languages I am focused on for analysis include R, Python, and SQL, which I use to extract insights and derive meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
