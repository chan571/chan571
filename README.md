ðŸ‘‹ Hello

Welcome to my space! A little about me: I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle, working toward my Master of Science in Information Management. My focus is on using programming languages like R, Python, and SQL to analyze data and uncover insights that help make sense of complex datasets.
